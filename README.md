**Project management for the pool construction industry**

**Introduction**

PoolBirdie mission is to help pool owners and vendors gain some transparency and helpful insight about their pool construction project powered by blockchain.

**Problem Statement**

Building a pool is an exciting project unfortunately the construction takes up months a year, involving the right pool vendor with a village of subcontractors. Ranging from sales, design phase, permit, construction phase, to warranty, it involves many critical milestones and subcontractors. One delay unfortunately could have a ripple effect on the subsequent phases, ultimately could cause months of delay from the target completion date. 

During this construction process, many pool owners are left in limbo. Pool owners are left hanging as they do not have an insight into what is happening at any given phase. At times, we found that the pool vendor is not communicating properly and effectively create some anxieties for many pool owners while waiting for their pool to be completed. 

**Solution**

PoolBirdie is a communication platform for both pool vendors, subcontractors, and homeowners all in one platform. 
It is powered by blockchain technology to create transparency in project management, creating peace of mind for the pool owners.  
Pool vendor can manage their project easily, get real-time updates from their subcontractors, and can be viewed instantly by the pool owners. Any delay can be communicated effectively thus the expectations can be managed sooner than later.  

**Scope of Project.**
1. Pool vendor creates a project, including the pool design, location, and pool owner.
2. Pool vendor invites all the subcontractors to join the project.
3. Pool vendor assigns the task to the subcontractors.
4. Subcontractors update the status including date and notes.
5. Homeowner receives a notification.
